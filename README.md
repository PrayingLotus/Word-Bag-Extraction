# Word-Bag-Extraction
The purpose of this program is to read over a PDF document, take all of the words in the document, and then tokenize them. After tokenizing,
the program then removes all unecessary symbols and stop-words. After it has done this, it will display a data table in a web browser
with each of the remaining words, as well as the frequency they appeared in the document. 

There is also a GUI that opens up that allows user input, such as which file to read over (FILE NAME NOT ABLE TO BE DISPLAYED CURRENTLY), 
and the number of words to be displayed (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED).
